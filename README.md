# wdm-aoc
Advent of Code Automation Runner

### Installation

Use commandbox.

```
install wdm-aoc
```

### Command Help

Use the following commands to learn how to use each command (aoc init, aoc input, aoc submit). 


```
aoc init help
aoc input help
aoc submit help
```

### Disclaimer

The commands are working blazingly fast. However, I haven't included any docs on how I use the commands as part of my workflow. 

Obviously, it is very trivial - doing it manually via the website is already easy enough. But taking this automation path did force me to think about my 
daily workflow, plus I learned a little more about creating custom commands for commandbox.
